//For each line on your ticket, check whether or not the result matches. If it does, you win the amount specified on the ticket for that match. Like this:

//Away:£20
//Home:£10
//Draw:£5
//[1-0, 2-1, 0-1]
//Results in Winnings = £10 (first bet lost, second bet won, third bet lost);

//Return your total winning as a string with the £ sign like this: '£100'
